// SCALING OPTIONS
// scaling can have values as follows with full being the default
// "fit"	sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit inside window size
// "outside"	sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit outside window size
// "full"	sets stage to window size with no scaling
// "tagID"	add canvas to HTML tag of ID - set to dimensions if provided - no scaling

var scaling = "fit"; // this will resize to fit inside the screen dimensions
var width = 1024;
var height = 768;
var color = light; // ZIM colors like green, blue, pink, faint, clear, etc. available globally
var outerColor = dark; // any HTML colors like "violet", "#333", etc. fine to use

var frame = new Frame(scaling, width, height, color, outerColor);
frame.on("ready", function() {
    zog("ready from ZIM Frame"); // logs in console (F12 - choose console)

    var stage = frame.stage;
    var stageW = frame.width;
    var stageH = frame.height;
